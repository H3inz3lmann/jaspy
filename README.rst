Jaspy
=====
Jaspy is a Python VM written entirely from scratch in JavaScript with interpreter size
and greenlet support in mind. It interprets CPython 3.5 bytecode within the browser and
aims to replace JavaScript as main web scripting language. Just joking, but seriously why
are there no browser plugins for different scripting languages.
